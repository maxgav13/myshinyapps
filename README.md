Links and descriptions of shiny apps I've created

* [Layer Boundary](https://maximiliano-01.shinyapps.io/layer_boundary/): Different methods can be used to find layer boundaries in a data sequence; unvariate and multivariate methods are available.

* [Rock Mechanics](https://maximiliano-01.shinyapps.io/rock_mechanics/): Implements basic rock mechanics' classification and failure criterion.

* [Directional Statistics](https://maximiliano-01.shinyapps.io/directional/): Used to analyze directional data (strike, dip, lineations, etc) with some basic plots and one and two sample statistics.

* [Geotechnical Engineering / Soil Mechancs](https://maximiliano-01.shinyapps.io/soil_mechanics/): Mostly for teaching concepts in soil mechanics (bearing capacity and induced stress).

* [Geostatistics](https://maximiliano-01.shinyapps.io/geostatistics/): Basic workflow for a geostatistical analysis.
